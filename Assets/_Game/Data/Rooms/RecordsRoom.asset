  startingRoomDescription: There's papers everywhere...and I mean everywhere. I think
    this room is more dangerous than any other room because of all the paper cuts.
  roomDescriptions:
  - I can probably make a sword out of this paper....
  - I think there are records in this room...Why did they use discs and not like...a
    recorder...?
  - I should take one of these discs back to the safe room...
