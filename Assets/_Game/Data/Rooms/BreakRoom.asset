  startingRoomDescription: Broken chairs, old food rotting in the air. Feels like
    a break room...The smell is unbearable...a smelly break room...
  roomDescriptions:
  - How long has this food been rotting...?
  - I wonder if I'll start to smell like rotting cheese if I stay here longer...
  - If I ever eat the food in this room...I hope the creature eats me first.
  - I will never eat cheese as long as I live...cheese sucks...it smells bad....I
    hate it so much...
