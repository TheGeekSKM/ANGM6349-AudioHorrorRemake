  startingRoomDescription: "Everything\u2019s upturned. Tables, chairs. Literally
    nothing is where it should be. Like a storm hit it. I think this room might be
    the closest room to the surface."
  roomDescriptions:
  - Oh shit, more wires...
  - I wonder if these machines can be ripped off the wall...I'm also not that strong,
    though...huh....I...I think I just tried to flex and <b>look</b> at my arms...
  - Goddamn it...I just stepped on another wire!!!
  - If I step on another wire...I might kill this creature and then, myself.
