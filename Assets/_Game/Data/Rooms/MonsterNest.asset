  startingRoomDescription: All I smell are rot and decay...my feet step on small
    spheres that crack and ooze under my feet...I think these are eggs....Oh shit
    this is the creature's nest, isn't it?
  roomDescriptions:
  - I might just eat these eggs....
  - Can I throw these eggs to distract the creatures??
  - I wonder if I can hide stuff in this room...Would the creature check it's own
    nest?
  - Ewwwwwww I hate eggs....
