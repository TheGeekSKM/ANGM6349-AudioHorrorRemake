  startingRoomDescription: "The smell of disinfectant, mixed with rot. Beds overturned.
    Metal tools scatter underfoot. This was an infirmary once\u2014now it's a graveyard..."
  roomDescriptions:
  - The familiar scent of decay. My feet catch on the same twisted bed frame. The
    infirmary... no safer than before...
  - It still smells like disinfectant and rot mixed together...
  - I wonder how many sick people were kept in this room...
  - The decay clings to the air, just like before. I need to move.
  - "Another step, another reminder\u2014this place hasn\u2019t improved."
