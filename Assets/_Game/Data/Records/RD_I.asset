    systems. There\u2019s nothing standing between me and the release now. But the
    creatures... the ones we couldn\u2019t save. If they get out while I\u2019m freeing
    the prisoners... it\u2019ll be a massacre. I\u2019m gambling with all of our
    lives. I know that. But if I don\u2019t act, those prisoners are as good as dead
    anyway. I can only hope I make it in time.\r\n"
