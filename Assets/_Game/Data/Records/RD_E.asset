  _recordsTranscript: "The final stage. They\u2019re beasts now, wretched things,
    mindless. What once were prisoners are now... monsters. Some barely have bodies
    left, just flesh hanging off bones. But they obey, most of the time. We have
    succeeded, in a way. But there\u2019s no turning back. No reversing this. We\u2019ve
    created something that no one\u2014no one\u2014should ever witness."
