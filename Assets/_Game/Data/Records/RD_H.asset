  _recordsTranscript: "There\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t stop thinking about. The
    ones who\u2019ve already turned. They\u2019re not like the others anymore. They\u2019ve
    changed\u2014completely. The serum has... done something else to them, something
    we didn\u2019t foresee. If they get loose, no one in this facility will survive.
    I\u2019m risking everything. But the prisoners... they deserve a chance. Maybe
    they can still escape before it\u2019s too late."
