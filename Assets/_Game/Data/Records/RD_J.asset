  _recordsTranscript: "This is it. The prisoners will be free in minutes. I can already
    hear the creatures stirring. They\u2019re clawing at the containment walls. If
    anything goes wrong\u2014if they break through... that\u2019s it\u2026it\u2019s
    over. For all of us. This place will fall, and the creatures will be unstoppable.
    If anyone finds this, leave. Don\u2019t try to fight.  It\u2019s too late for
    all of us."
