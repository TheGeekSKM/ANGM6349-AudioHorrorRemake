  ItemName: Old Bandage
  ItemDescription: The bandages are barely holding on, but atleast it'll hold the
    infection for a bit longer...Some of them are used though...
  ItemUsageDescription:
  - I wrapped my wounds...I feel slightly better, I suppose.
  - I just used a bandage...I better be careful with these.
  - Good thing the creature can't exactly wrap itself with bandages...I'd piss my
    pants if it did...
  - I used another bandage...
  - phewww....I feel slightly better physically...mentally though, I am still beyond
    screwed....
