  ItemDescription: I don't exactly know what's in this syringe...but...and don't
    laugh...I feel like it makes me faster....eh, if I'm gonna die, at least I'll
    die high as balls.
  ItemUsageDescription:
  - gods, I love being high...and fast, too...but mainly high.
  - If I just take like a billion of these...I can probably phase through the walls.
  - I could always just stab the guy with these...actually, he might talk more...nevermind...
  - I just stabbed myself...and now I'm fast as hell.
  - This shit is better than therapy...and it makes me fast, too.
